# CCNA_PROJECTS
PROJECT:
With this Project/Assignment, I designed a sample network for an Enterprise. This Enterprise has 2 Locations (Location A & Location B).
It is a kind of Secure Campus Area Network where in Location B, there is a Main Server with IP of 172.18.51.1. Only PC0 to PC5 can Access this server.
They can't ping it but they can access the web services via Port 80. Nobody else can access the Server. This Implementation is done through Installing Network Based Firewall at Router 6.
